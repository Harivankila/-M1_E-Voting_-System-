# Description                                                                       
                                                                        
E-voting (Electronic Voting) as a term encompasses a broad range of voting systems that apply electronic elements in one or more steps of the electoral cycle.There are many levels to e-voting in a broad sense which could be e-collation, e-verification, internet voting, remote online voting.Following the definition of a system as anything that takes an input and gives an output, an e-voting system is any system that can offers both electronic and online voting.

E-voting system serves to reduce the cumulative costs of running elections and increase voters participation in election system as it offers voters an easy and convenient way to vote and most importantly, it is a panacea to the issue of long distances covered by voters to a specific destination for their votes to be counted.

# Aim
The aim of this project is to design and implement a low cost automated real-time e-voting system.

# Objectives

The main Objectives includes:

1.A detailed study of the election processes as it pertains to voting.
2.Design and develop a software platforms for voter registration, election voting, real-time election results collation and monitoring and mostly for voters remote access to elections.
3.Design and develop an electronic device that incorporates smart card reader and fingerprintstechnology for voters accreditation, authentication and verification.
4.Design and develop an administration dashboard for the election administrators.
Run simulations and compare the results of the designed e-voting system and other voting systems.

# Benifits

1.It will provide INEC (Independent National Electoral Commission)
2.It will serve to reduce the workload in the process of conducting election.
3.As it incorporates remote voting individuals can vote from their convenience.
4.It will greatly reduce and eliminate disenfranchising electorates.
